Hello

There are two more hours to Deadline (11.30) but I can see that I won't be able to finish the task. Simple in the description, and yet took a lot of time. I based the task on foundation 6 - but it's not easy to solve all aspects of a "simple" project. The home page is visually done, by 11:00 am I will finish JavaScript. There was not enough time to make parts with PopUp and responsiveness.

The project is without php - only Html, CSS and JavaScript.

Should I upload before 11.30 what I have done or is it possible for a second deadline?

Regards
